==========
Exercise 1  (.../25)

What is the name of the frame containing variable "area_of_disk"?

# The name of the frame containing the variable "area_of_disk" is global frame 

What does variable "area_of_disk" refer to?

# The variable of the "area_of_disk" is in reference to the calculations needed to find the disk's area 

What is the name of the frame containing parameter "radius"?

# The function which contains the parameter "radius" is the area_of_disk 

When does the frame containing parameter radius appear in the memory diagram?

# The frame containing the radius as a parameter appears right after the line where area = area_of_disk(5.0) is executed since the function is being called

What is the type and value of the variable "radius"? Where did that value come from?

# radius is a parameter where passes a value into the function "area_of_disk" and in this case value of the variable "radius" is 5.0 which is a float

How does PyTutor depict the value the function will return?

# PyTutor reads the lines of code starting from the first line which is importing the entire math library, then it reads the defined function called area_of_disk which has a parameter called radius
# The next line PyTutor reads is the variable area which calls the function and passes 5.0 into it, so the next line PyTutor reads is the return statement math.pi * radius ** 2 and this is binded to the area variable    
# To get a final answer of a float value of 78.5398 which is binded to the area variable
When does the frame containing "radius" disappear?

# The frame which contains the radius disappears after the frame returns a value, then the value returned is binded to the variable called "area"

What is the name of the frame containing the variable "area"? 

# The frame name of the area variable is global frame

When does "area" appear in the frame?

# After the frame returns 78.5398 then the next line to be executed is area binded to the value

What is the type and value of "area"? Where did that value come from?

# area is 78.5398 which is a float. This value came from the radius returned value which is calculated using the formula math.pi * radius ** 2 

==========
Exercise 2 (.../10) 

What value does "area_of_disk" return each time it is called?

# The first time it is called the returned value is 78.5398
# The second time it is called the returned value is 78.5398
# The third time it is called the returned value is 78.5398
# The fourth time it is called the returned value is 78.5398

==========
Exercise 3 (.../25)

What is the name of the frame containing parameters "inner" and "outer"?

# The frame containing the "inner" and "outer" parameters is called area_of_ring

When does the frame appear in the memory diagram?

# The frame appears after the math library is imported 

What are the types and values of the variables "inner" and "outer"? 

# The float values of the "inner" and "outer" variables are 5.0 and 10.0 respectively

What caused those values to be bound to "inner" and "outer"?

# These values are bound to the "inner" and "outer" because these are the values passed into the "inner" and "outer" parameters

What is the name of the frame containing parameter "radius"? 

# The name of the frame is area_of_disk 

When does that frame appear in the memory diagram? How many times does it appear?

# The frame appears the first time when the function is defined, second is when the area_of_ring function is called in the area_of_disk(outer) , thirdly is when the function area_of_disk(radius) is called in the area_of_disk(inner) function   
# It is called 2 times but appears 3 times in the memory diagram  

Each time the frame containing "radius" appears, what is the type and value of
the object bound to "radius"? 

# The first time radius appears it is binded to 10.0 which is a float, then the second time it appears it is binded to 5.0 which is a float, then after the calculation of math.pi * radius ** 2 is done the float of 78.5398 is binded to radius


What caused that object to be bound to "radius"?

# The after the calculation of math.pi * radius ** 2 is done the float of 78.5398 is binded to radius

When does the frame containing "radius" disappear?

# The frame containing radius disappears after returning the value 78.5398

When does the frame containing "inner" and "outer" disappear?

# The frame containing "inner" and "outer" disappears right after the float value 235.6194 is returned by subtracting the area_of_disk(outer) which is computed as 314.1593 and area_of_disk(inner) which is computed as 78.5398  

What is the name of the frame containing the variable "area"? 

# The name of the frame containing the variable area is the global frame 

When does "area" appear in the frame?

# The area appears in the frame after the float value 235.6194 is binded to the variable called area 

What is the type and value of the object bound to "area"? 

# area is a float type and the object binded to it is the value 235.6194

What caused that object to be bound to "area"?

# Because area = the function area_of_ring(10.0, 5.0) so after all the calculations were finished the result is binded to the variable area due to the "=" operator

==========
Exercise 4 (.../20)

What is the type of the object returned by the function when there is
no return statement?

# The type of object returned when there is no return statementis a NoneType


What is the value of the object returned by the function when there is
no return statement?

# The value of the object returned when there is no return statement is None

==========
Exercise 5 (.../20)

When "cube" is called, but before Python executes x = x ** 3, what value is
bound to parameter "x"? What value is bound to variable "a"?

# The value bound to parameter x is the integer 2 , and the value bound to the variable a is the integer 2 when "cube" is called but before it is executed 

After Python executes x = x ** 3, but before the function returns, what value
is bound to parameter "x"? What value is bound to variable "a"?

# The value bound to parameter x is the integer 8 , and the value bound to the variable a is the integer 2

In Python code, does assigning a value to a function's parameter change the 
corresponding function argument?

# No, it does not change the function's parameter. For example if there is a function called add and its perameters is (a,b) instead of a and b you could put (5,6) and this will not change the function's parameter
